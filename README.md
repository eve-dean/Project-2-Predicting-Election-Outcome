Another goal of this notebook if to predict the number of votes cast. 
All predictions are based on demographic characteristics of counties and states, specifially looking at:
- racial/ethinic breakdown
-gender breakdown of the population
- additionally, another model was developed using economic factors (retail sales, food service, etc)

Kaggle dataset of 2016 primary election results
